 ## Exercise - Adopt Protocols: CustomStringConvertible, Equatable, and Comparable
 
 Create a `Human` class with two properties: `name` of type `String`, and `age` of type `Int`. You'll need to create a memberwise initializer for the class. Initialize two `Human` instances.

    let name: String
    let age: Int
    
    init(name: String, age: Int) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    var description: String {
        return "\(name) is \(age) years old."

    static func == (lhs: Human, rhs: Human) -> Bool {
        if lhs.name == rhs.name && lhs.age == rhs.age {

/*:
 Make the `Human` class adopt the `CustomStringConvertible`. Print both of your previously initialized `Human` objects.
 */


/*:
 Make the `Human` class adopt the `Equatable` protocol. Two instances of `Human` should be considered equal if their names and ages are identical to one another. Print the result of a boolean expression evaluating whether or not your two previously initialized `Human` objects are equal to eachother (using `==`). Then print the result of a boolean expression evaluating whether or not your two previously initialized `Human` objects are not equal to eachother (using `!=`).
 */


/*:
 Make the `Human` class adopt the `Comparable` protocol. Sorting should be based on age. Create another three instances of a `Human`, then create an array called `people` of type `[Human]` with all of the `Human` objects that you have initialized. Create a new array called `sortedPeople` of type `[Human]` that is the `people` array sorted by age.

let justin = Human(name: "Justin", age: 17)

/*:
 Make the `Human` class adopt the `Codable` protocol. Create a `JSONEncoder` and use it to encode as data one of the `Human` objects you have initialized. Then use that `Data` object to initialize a `String` representing the data that is stored, and print it to the console.
